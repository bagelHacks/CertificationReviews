# OSCP Review 2021

### Audience
Hello, this post is for those who are considering taking this certification as well as those interested in the resources I used to prepare for this battle.  

### Whoami

My name is Beyviel, and I currently work as a Cyber Threat Analyst for an MSSP. I fell in love with computer's when I started my journey in late 2017 and some of the certifications I hold are Sec+, CCNA, CYSA, and EJPT. I heard about the OSCP from a coworker, and after reading many online review's I decided that this would be something I would enjoy. I was casually studying for this in July of 2020, but once I finished my Bachelor's (Dec. 2020), I got serious and passed on my first attempt in July. 

### Preparation 

I started by taking the "Practical Ethical Hacking" course by Heath Adams (The Cyber Mentor). This is a quality course, and for 30$ it is one of the best. I loved the AD section and Heath is a great teacher. This was not very relevant to the Exam, but very relevant to working in a SOC. This course also covered exploiting Buffer Overflow's which is guaranteed to be on the exam. 

Next, I went to TryHackMe and finished the "Complete Beginner" and the "Offensive Pentesting" paths. This requires an $8 subscription, but gave me some confidence working boxes. This has a lot of hand holding, but covers lots of technique in a nice structured way. The Buffer Overflow room gave me lots of practice developing exploit code.

I went back and completed the Heath Adam's Linux and Privilege escalation coursed on Udemy. You can probably tell that I'm a huge fan and for good reason. These courses gave a good foundation for privilege escalation needed for the exam and for work in general. Watching these courses alone are not enough to pass the privilege escalation on the exam. 

Next, I spent some time doing VirtualHackingLabs. I bought a three month pass finished most of these boxes and picked up both of the Certificate of Completions. These were very good quality, and I liked how much detail the PDF included. The downside is there are few windows boxes and I had more kernel escalations then any other privilege escalation method. Repetition is necessary for building a good methodology and by the end, I had a good web application approach.

By this time, I was feeling more confident. I knew that I had the BOF down, I just needed to get better at privilege escalation. 
I went for Offensive Security Proving Grounds labs, which costed $20 a month. These are more difficult then the exam (and difficult for me). I needed hints/walkthroughs for many of these machines, but I learned a ton. By this time, I was happy with my privilege escalation methodology. 

Around this time, I bought 60 days of lab time which included the OSCP exam vouchure. I did about 15 of the machines, but I did not like how unstructured it was. I was spoiled from THM,Proving Grounds and VirtualHackingLabs. 

Instead, I decided to schedule my exam and move to HackTheBox. I played HTB before and had a hard time with easy boxes. I went after the recommended OSCP boxes by TJ Null and was able to complete most of them without hints. Many of the easy/medium machines were actually more difficult then the exam. 

I used OneNote to document every box I rooted and learned lots of cool tricks along the way such as TMUX shortcuts, bash one liner's and nice methodology in my head. Before the exam, I made sure that I filled the reporting template with what I could and reviewed until exam day. 

## Exam Day
I scheduled my exam for Saturday morning at 8 am. I went to sleep around 11 pm, and felt good. I did not have any issues setting up and showing off my 4 monitor setup to the proctors. I used autorecon to start the portscans on all the targets in the background while I tackled the Buffer Overflow. This took me about 2.5 hours which is longer then I expected. No big deal, I took a break and continued on. By the time it was 3am, I had a foothold on every machine, and needed 2 more escalations to get 100%. I stayed two more hours and I could'nt figure out and completed my exam around 5am. I kept telling myself "The battle is just beginning". I was listening to hyped up music and took plenty of snack breaks. 

I slept for about 4 hours and spent the next day writing my report which ended up being almost 100 pages. I made sure to detail every command and meaning of every argument I used. I turned the report in and received my passing emails 2 days later.
